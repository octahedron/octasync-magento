Copy and paste the client ID and secret from above into the respective fields and hit save.  A success message will pop up if the connection was successful otherwise ensure all the fields have been entered correctly.

Finally, navigate to **Octahedron** > **Sync** and click **Perform Sync** to populate your Magento site with data pulled from your Octahedron ERP software.
