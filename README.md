# octasync-magento
A Magento extension for integrating with Octahedron ERP software.

**Requirements:** Magento 1.9.x

## Installation
Download the latest version and merge with your Magento installation.

## Configuration
In your Octahedron ERP application, navigate to **Utilities** > **Other** > **Applications** and create a new application.

**Note: the generated client ID and secret will be used to integrate Magento with your ERP software.**

While there, edit the webhook configuration for the new application and add your Magento webhook URL (e.g. *http<nolink>://yourmagentosite.com/pos/webhooks*). Also, subscribe to the  **Stock Change**, **Tax Change**, and **Category Change** events.

In your Magento admin site, navigate to **System** > **Configuration** > **Point of Sale** and enter the address of your Octahedron ERP (e.g. *yourcompany.onswim.com*).  Copy and paste the client ID and secret from above into the respective fields and hit save.  A success message will pop up if the connection was successful otherwise ensure all the fields have been entered correctly.

Finally, navigate to **Octahedron** > **Sync** and click **Perform Sync** to populate your Magento site with data pulled from your Octahedron ERP software.

### Initial Stock Picture Import

After the sync is complete, you may wish to import the stock pictures from your Octahedron ERP application.  Before importing, you will need to set up a bulk image import profile via **System** > **Import/Export** > **Dataflow - Profiles**.  Click **Add New Profile** and give it the name **Bulk Image Import**.  Under **Data Format**, change the **Type** to **CSV / Tab separated** and add the following **Field Mapping**s:

- In Database: **sku** <--> In File: **sku**
- In Database: **image** <--> In File: **image**
- In Database: **small_image** <--> In File: **small_image**

Click **Save and Continue Edit** and head over to your Octahedron ERP application to download the pictures with corresponding CSV file via the following link: **https<nolink>://yourcompany.onswim.com/stock/pictures/export** (replacing **yourcompany** with your actual subdomain).  You will need to extract the archive and upload all the pictures to the **media/import** directory of your Magento server (creating the **import** directory if it doesn't exist).

Finally, back on the **Bulk Image Import** profile page, click the **Upload File** tab and select the CSV from the downloaded archive. Click **Save and Continue Edit** and then the **Run Profile** tab.  The uploaded CSV should appear in the dropdown. Select the file and click **Run Profile in Popup** where a new tab will open with the results of the picture import.
